I know I cannot believe this view too.



## Code

Embed code by putting `{{ "{% highlight language " }}%}` `{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}` blocks around it. Adding the parameter `linenos` will show source lines besides the code.

{% highlight c %}

static void asyncEnabled(Dict* args, void* vAdmin, String* txid, struct Allocator* requestAlloc)
{
    struct Admin* admin = Identity_check((struct Admin*) vAdmin);
    int64_t enabled = admin->asyncEnabled;
    Dict d = Dict_CONST(String_CONST("asyncEnabled"), Int_OBJ(enabled), NULL);
    Admin_sendMessage(&d, txid, admin);
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Gists

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.
{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDSOOtWAF0k" %}
{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_C0A5zX-iqM" %}
