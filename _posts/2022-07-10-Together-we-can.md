I know I cannot believe this view too.

# Leading up to the day
I was certainly questioning why I choose to do this when so many people attempted to talk me out of it. I have to admit the funniest thing I heard that day was when two of the skydivers slyly made an attempt at humour by saying, refuel the chopper halfway petrol, why? prices are high enough so it should last longer, i THINK.


## You would not actually think so but..

I would have thought the height would be the scariest aspect of a skydive. It funnily enough was not, rather it was the waiting on the plane that gets to you. But the views were spectacular to say the least.

## Two feet safely on the ground

I can say for sure it was the most exhilirating, awe inspiring experience that no ride may ever compare to. I would be ernst enough to say I may not want to tempt fate again. However, you never know what the future has for you, I could be skydiving with the SAS for a top secret mission.

## Chill after that rush

Nice sound if you are in the mood for a listen.
