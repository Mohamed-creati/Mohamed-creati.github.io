## The mind cache of hidden thoughts

This page os for me to relieve some thoughts that would not be that helpful in a blog.


You would probably say 'I thought that was what a blog was'. I mean kind of.

 
 I just want my website to be different, that is my answer, so there.



## Beyond the horizon (part 1)

What I hope the future, well that can be construde to saying "I want to be living in a utopia". 

I will have something different to say, as to eliminate the challenges of life and just lump them all together and say thery are a burden is not ideal. I would call my so called utopia to have some aspects of a inclusivce world however, to keep the challenges of the world but facing them as one planet.

If you have another opinion share it I would love to get someone else to illuminate me with their opinion.
